        <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was built along the northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.</p>
        <p>The wall stretches over 13,000 miles and was constructed over several dynasties, with the most famous sections built by the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). It is one of the most impressive architectural feats in history and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
        <p>Today, the Great Wall of China is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors from around the world each year.</p>
