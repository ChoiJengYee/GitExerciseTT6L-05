        <p>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, England, and is often extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.</p>
        <p>The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. The tower stands 316 feet (96 meters) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps.</p>
        <p>Big Ben is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world and is a symbol of London and the United Kingdom.</p>
